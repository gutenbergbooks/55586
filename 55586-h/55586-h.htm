<p>Present day life calls into question
many things which man has
inherited from his ancestors
hence the numberless questions
of the day, as for example: the
Social Problem, the Woman’s
Movement, Education and School
Questions, Law Reform, Hygiene,
Sanitation, and so forth. We try
to grapple with these questions in
manifold ways. The number of
those who bring forward this or
that remedy in order to solve this
or that question, or at least to contribute
something towards its solution,
is immeasurably great, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
every possible shade of opinion is
manifested in these endeavors;
radicalism, carrying itself with a
revolutionary air; the moderate
view, full of respect for existing
things and desirous of fashioning
out of them something new; or
conservatism, up in arms, whenever
old institutions and traditions
are tampered with; and
besides these main attitudes, there
are all sorts of intermediary points
of view.</p>

<p>He who is able to probe deeply
into life cannot help feeling one
thing with regard to these phenomena—that
the claims which are
placed before men in our time are
met repeatedly by inadequate
means. Many would like to re-form
life, without really knowing
it from its foundations. He who
would put forth a proposition as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
to life in the future, must not content
himself with merely learning
to know life superficially. He
must probe it to its depths.</p>

<p>Life is like a plant that contains
not only that which is visible to
the eye, but also a future condition
concealed within its secret depths.
He who has before him a plant
that is just in leaf, is well aware
that later on blossoms and fruit
will be added to the leaf-bearing
stem. The germs of these blossoms
and fruit are already concealed
within the plant. But it is impossible
for one who merely regards
it in its present condition to
say how these organs will ultimately
appear. Only he who is acquainted
with the nature of the
plant can do so.</p>

<p>Human life also contains within
itself the germs for its future.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
But to be able to say anything
about this future one must penetrate
into the hidden nature of
man, and this, the present age,
has no real inclination to do. It
busies itself with the surface and
thinks itself treading on unsafe
ground should it advance into that
which is hidden from external observation.
With the plant it is
true the matter is considerably
simpler. We know that its like
has often and often brought forth
flowers and fruit. Human life
exists but once and the flowers
which it is to bring forth in the
future were not previously there.
None the less they exist in human
life in embryo, just as much as the
flowers of the plant which at present
is only just bearing leaves.</p>

<p>And it is possible to say something
about this future, when one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
penetrates beneath the surface,
into the heart of human nature.
The different reformatory ideas of
the present can only become really
fruitful and practical, when they
are the result of this deep research
into human life.</p>

<p>Theosophy is suited by its very
nature to present a practical philosophy,
comprehending the whole
sphere of human life. Whether or
not Theosophy, or that which in
our time so often passes for it, is
justified in putting forth such a
claim, is not the point. The point
concerns rather the nature of Theosophy
and what, by means of this
nature, it is able to accomplish.
It ought not to be a colorless
theory to satisfy the mere curiosity
of knowledge, nor yet a
medium for those men who, out of
selfishness, would like to win for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
themselves a higher grade of evolution.
It can contribute something
to the most important problems
of present day Humanity, in
the development of its well-being.</p>

<p>Of course if it acknowledges a
mission of this kind it must expect
to meet with all manner of opposition
and doubt. Radicals, Moderates
and Conservatives of all
departments in life will surely
raise such doubts against it. For
at first it will be unable to please
any one party, because its doctrines
reach far beyond all party
motives.</p>

<p>And these doctrines have their
roots wholly and solely in the true
understanding of life. Only he
who understands life will be able
to take his lessons from life itself.
He will draw up no capricious
schemes, for he knows that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
other fundamental laws of life will
prevail in the future than such as
prevail in the present. Theosophy
will therefore of necessity have respect
for the existing state of
things. Even, should it still find
in what is existent, very much that
might be improved, yet it will not
fail to perceive in the present the
germs of the future. But it knows,
too, that for all things nascent
there is a growth and a development.
Therefore the germs for a
transformation and for a future
growth will appear to Theosophy
in the existing state of things. It
invents no schemes, it only calls
them forth from what already
exists. But that which is so called
forth becomes in a certain sense
itself a scheme, for it contains
within itself the nature of evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>For this very reason the theosophical
way of delving into the
nature of man must yield the most
fruitful and practical means for
the solution of the vitally important
questions of the present time.</p>

<p>It is my purpose to apply this
to one such question, namely that
of education. We do not intend to
advance any claims or pronounce
a learned dissertation, but to portray
simply the child nature. From
a study of the nature of the growing
man, the educational standpoint
here suggested will develop
quite naturally. But to proceed
rightly with such a study it is
necessary to contemplate the hidden
nature of man in general.</p>

<p>That which is cognised by the
physical perception, that which the
materialistic view of life considers
to be the only important element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in the nature of man, namely, his
physical body, forms, according to
spiritual research, only a part, a
principle of human nature. This
physical body is subject to the
same laws of physical life, is composed
of the same matter and
forces, as all the rest of the so-called
lifeless world. Theosophy,
therefore, maintains that man possesses
this physical aspect in common
with the whole of the mineral
kingdom. And it considers as
physical body that part only in
man which is able to mix, unite, to
build up and to dissolve the very
same materials, and after identical
laws, as are also at work in the
mineral world.</p>

<p>Now besides this physical body,
Theosophy recognizes a second element
in the constitution of man—namely
a vital or etheric body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
And that there may be no cause
for the physicist to reject the term
etheric body we would point out
that etheric is here used in a
different sense from the hypothetical
ether of physics, and it
must be taken to mean here that
which is about to be described.</p>

<p>It has been considered for some
time past a most unscientific proceeding
to speak of an “etheric
body” of this kind. At the end of
the eighteenth and in the first half
of the nineteenth century, it is
true, it was not considered “unscientific.”
It was then said that
matter and force operating in a
mineral could not of their own
power form themselves into a living
being. For this there must be
an especial indwelling “force,”
which was termed “vital force.”
It was represented indeed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
such a force operates in plants, in
animals, and in human bodies, and
produces the phenomena of life
just as magnetic force in the magnet
causes attraction. In the succeeding
period of materialism this
theory had been abandoned. It
was then said that a living being
builds itself up in the same way
as a so-called lifeless being; no
other forces prevail in an organism
than those which are in the
mineral—they only operate in a
more complicated manner; they
build up a more complex structure.
At the present time, only
the most obstinate materialists
cling to this denial of the “vital
force.” A number of natural
philosophers have taught that one
must nevertheless admit some such
thing as a vital force of a life-principle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>Thus the new science approaches
in a certain sense the
teaching of Theosophy in regard
to the vital body. Nevertheless
there is a considerable difference
between the two. Science today,
by means of intellectual observations
founded on the facts of ordinary
perception, has accepted
the idea of a kind of vital force.
But this is not the method of a
truly spiritual research, such as
Theosophy aims at, and from the
results of which proceed the theosophical
teachings. It cannot be
pointed out too often, how Theosophy
on this point differs from
the current science of the day.
The latter considers the experience
of the senses to be the basis
of all knowledge, and whatever is
not built upon this basis it treats
as unknowable. From the impressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of the senses it draws deductions
and conclusions. But
anything that goes further it puts
aside, as being beyond the limits
of human knowledge. To Theosophy
such a prospect resembles
the view of a blind man who only
takes into consideration those
things that he can touch, and
what he may infer from the
touched object by reasoning, but
who sets aside the statements of
those who can see as being beyond
the faculty of human perception.
For Theosophy shows that
man is capable of evolution, that
through the developing of new
organs he may conquer for himself
new worlds. Around the
blind man there is color and light,
but he cannot perceive them, because
he does not possess the requisite
organs. Around man, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Theosophy teaches, there are many
worlds, and he can observe them,
if only he develops the organs
necessary for the purpose.</p>

<p>Even as the blind man looks
upon a new world as soon as he
has undergone a successful operation,
so can man, through the developing
of higher organs, perceive
worlds quite different from
those which he observed at first
with his ordinary senses. Now
whether or not it is possible to
operate on one who is bodily blind
depends on the conditions of the
organs; but those higher organs
by which one may penetrate into
the upper worlds, exist in embryo
in every human being. Anyone
can develop them, who has the
patience, endurance and energy to
make use of those methods which
are described in my two books entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
“The Way of Initiation”
and “Initiation and Its Results.”<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Theosophy does not speak of limitations
to man’s knowledge through
his organism; but says, on the
contrary, that he is surrounded by
worlds for which he has the
organs of perception. It indicates
the means by which to extend
the temporary limits. It also
occupies itself with the investigation
of the vital, or etheric body,
and to what in the following may
be called the yet higher principles
of human nature. It admits that
only the physical body can be accessible
to the investigation of the
bodily senses, and that from this
standpoint one can at most only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
chance on something higher by a
train of reasoning. But it gives
information as to how one can
open up for oneself a world in
which these higher principles of
human nature appear before the
observer, just as the colors and
light of objects appear before the
blind-born person after his operation.
For those who have developed
the higher organs of perception,
the etheric or vital body is an
object of actual observation, and
not a theory resulting from intellectual
activity or a train of reasoning.</p>

<p>Man has this etheric, or vital
body, in common with the plants
and animals. It causes the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and forces of the physical body
to form themselves into the manifestations
of growth, of reproduction,
of the internal motions of the
fluids, etc. It is also the builder
and sculptor of the physical body,
its inhabitant and its architect.
The physical body can therefore
also be called an image or expression
of this vital body. Both are
approximately the same in man as
regards form and size, yet they
are by no means quite alike. But
the etheric body in animals and
still more in plants, differs considerably
from the physical body
with regard to its shape and dimension.</p>

<p>The third principle of the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
being is the so-called body of feeling,
or astral body. It is the
vehicle of pain and pleasure, of
impulse, desire, passion, and so
forth. An entity composed merely
of a physical and an etheric body
has nothing of all this, to which
may be ascribed the term—sensation.
The plant has no sensation.
If many a learned man of our
time concludes that plants have a
certain power of sensation, from
the fact that many of them respond
to a stimulus, by movement,
or in other ways, he merely shows
that he does not know the essence
of sensation. The point is, not
whether the being in question responds
to an outward stimulus,
but rather whether the stimulus
reflects itself through an inner
experience, such as pleasure or
pain, impulse, desire, etc. If this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
be not the standard of sensation,
one would be justified in asserting
that blue litmus paper has a
sense of feeling for certain substances,
because on coming into
contact with them, it turns red.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Man has the astral body in common
with the animal world only.
It is thus the medium for the life
of sensation and feeling.</p>

<p>One must not fall into the error
of certain theosophical circles and
think that the etheric body and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>
<p>astral body consist merely of finer
matter than that which exists in
the physical body. For this would
mean simply the materialisation of
these higher principles of human
nature. The etheric body is a form
of living forces; it is composed of
active forces, but not of matter—and
the astral body or body of
feeling is a form consisting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
colored luminous pictures revolving
within themselves.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The astral body differs in form
and size from the physical body.
It appears in man in the form
of an oblong egg, in which the
physical and the etheric bodies
are embedded. It projects on all
sides beyond these two like a luminous
cloud.</p>

<p>Now in the nature of man there
is a fourth principle which he does
not share with other earthly creatures.
This is the vehicle of the
human “I”. The little word “I”
as we call it in English is a word
that separates itself from all other
words. He who duly reflects on</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>
<p>the nature of this word, gains access
at the same time to an understanding
of human nature. Every
other word may be used by all men
in the same way to suit some corresponding
object. Anyone can
call a table “table,” any one can
call a chair “chair,” but with the
word “I” it is not so. No one
can use it as an indication of
some one else, for each person can
only speak of himself as “I”.
Never can the word “I” sound in
my ears as a reference to myself.
For a man in designating himself
“I”, must name himself within
himself. A being that can say to
himself “I” is a world in himself.
Those religions which are built up
on the basis of Theosophy have
always felt this. They have therefore
said that with the “ego” the
God begins to speak within—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
God who, among lower beings, is
manifested only from without in
the surrounding phenomena.</p>

<p>The vehicle of this lastly developed
capacity is now “the body
of the ego,” the fourth principle
of the human being.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> This body
of the ego is the vehicle of the
higher human soul, and through
it man is the crown of all earthly
creation. But the ego in present
humanity is by no means a simple
entity. Its nature can be recognized
when a comparison is made
between men of different stages
of evolution. Take for instance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the uneducated savage and the
average European, and compare
these again with a lofty idealist.
Each one of them has the faculty
of saying to himself “I” for the
“body of the ego” is existent in
each of them. But the uncivilized
savage gives way with this “I” to
his passions, his impulses and appetites,
almost like an animal. The
more highly developed man allows
himself to follow certain inclinations
and desires, others he checks
or suppresses. The idealist has
formed, in addition to the original
inclinations and passions, others
that are higher. This is all due to
the fact that the “ego” has been
at work on the other principles of
the human being. And it is precisely
the mission of the “ego”
to ennoble and purify the other
principles by its own power.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>
<p>So the lower principles, under
the influence of the “ego,” have
become more or less changed
within a man who has surmounted
the conditions in which the outer
world has placed him. Take the
case of the man who is just raising
himself above the level of the animal—when
his “ego” flashes out
he still resembles the animal with
regard to his lower principles.
His etheric or vital body is solely
the medium of the living constructive
forces of growth and
propagation. His astral body only
gives expression to such impulses,
desires and passions as are
stimulated by his outer nature.
All the time that the man is
struggling on through successive
lives, or incarnations, from this
degree of culture to an ever higher
evolution, his ego is remodelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the other principles. In this way
the astral body becomes the
medium of purified pleasurable
and unpleasurable sensations, refined
desires and longings. And
the etheric, or vital body, also
transforms itself. It becomes the
vehicle of habits, of permanent inclinations
of temperament and of
memory. A man whose ego has not
yet influenced his vital body has
no remembrance of the experiences
he undergoes. He lives
just as he has been brought up
by Nature.</p>

<p>The whole development of civilisation
expresses itself for man
in this working of the ego upon
the subordinate principles. This
working penetrates even to the
physical body. Under the influence
of the ego, the physiognomy,
the gestures and movements, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
whole appearance of the physical
body, change.</p>

<p>One can also discern how differently
the various mediums of
civilisation affect the individual
principles of the human being.
The common factors of civilisation
influence the astral body.
They bring to it other kinds of
pleasure, displeasure, impulse, etc.,
than it originally had. Absorption
in a work of art influences the
etheric body, for a man obtains
through a work of art, the presentiment
of something higher
and nobler than that which is
offered by the environment of the
senses, and thus transforms his
vital body. A powerful means for
the purification and ennoblement
of the etheric body is religion.
Religious impulses have, in this
way, their sublime mission in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
evolution of humanity.</p>

<p>That which is called conscience
is nothing but the result of the
work of the ego on the vital body,
through a succession of incarnations.
When a man perceives that
he must not do certain things, and
when through this perception, an
impression is made on him, deep
enough to communicate itself to
his etheric body, the conscience
begins to be formed.</p>

<p>Now this work of the ego on the
subordinate principles can either
be one that belongs rather to the
whole human race, or it can be
quite individually a work of the
single ego upon itself. In the
first change of man, to a certain
extent, the whole human race
takes part; the latter must depend
on the inner activity of the
ego. When the ego grows strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
enough entirely to remodel the
astral body through its own
strength, then that which the ego
makes of this astral body or body
of feeling is called the “Spirit-Self”
(Geistesselbst)<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> or as they
say in the East, Manas. This transformation
consists essentially in
an imbuing, in an enriching of
the inner being with higher ideas
and perceptions. But the ego can
arrive at yet higher and more intimate
work with regard to the
special entity of man. This
occurs when not merely the astral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
body is enriched, but when the
etheric or vital body becomes
transformed. Man learns a certain
amount in the course of life,
and when he looks back on his
life from any point, he is able to
say to himself: “I have learnt
much,” but how much less is he
able to speak of a change of temperament
and character, of an improvement
or deterioration of the
memory, during life. Learning
affects the astral body, whilst the
latter transformations affect the
ethic or vital body. It would
therefore be no inapt simile to
compare the change of the astral
body in life to the movement of
the minute-hand of the clock, the
change of the vital body to that of
the hour-hand.</p>

<p>When a man enters upon the
higher, or so-called occult training,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the chief thing to bear in
mind is that he at once begins
this latter transformation by the
innermost might of the ego. He
must work quite consciously and
individually at the changing of
habits, temperament, character,
memory, etc. As much of this
vital body as he works upon in
this way becomes transformed
into the “Life-Spirit” (Lebensgeist),
or as the Eastern expression
has it, into Buddhi.</p>

<p>On a yet higher stage of evolution
man attains to powers by
which he can effect a transformation
of his physical body (as for
example, changing the pulse and
the circulation of the blood). As
much of the physical body as is
transformed in this way, is called
“Spirit-Man” (Geistesmensch)—Atma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>The changes which are effected
in the lower principles by man,
not as an individual, but rather as
a whole group of the human race,
or a part of it, such as a nation,
a tribe, or a family—have in
Theosophy, the following names.
The astral body, or body of feeling,
when transformed by the ego is
called the emotional soul; the
transformed etheric body becomes
the rational soul, and the transformed
physical body, the self-conscious
soul. But it is not to
be supposed that the transformation
of these three principles takes
place successively. It takes place
in all three bodies simultaneously,
from the moment when the ego
flashes out. Indeed the work of
the ego is not generally speaking
perceptible until a part of the
self-conscious soul is formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>It is seen from the foregoing
paragraph that there are four
principles in the Being of Man:
the physical body, the etheric or
vital body, the astral or body of
feeling and the ego-body;—the
emotional soul, the rational soul,
the self-conscious soul—and indeed
the yet higher principles of
human nature also,—the Spirit-Self
(Manas), the Life-Spirit
(Buddhi), the Spirit-Man (Atma)
appear as the products of the
transformation of these four principles.
In speaking about the
sources of our human capacities,
only these four principles can be
taken into account.</p>

<p>As a teacher works upon these
four principles of the human constitution,
one must, in order to
work in the right way, penetrate
into the nature of these divisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of man. Now it must by no means
be imagined that these parts develop
themselves in man in such a
way that at any one moment of
his life—say at his birth—they
are all equally advanced. On the
contrary their development takes
place at the various life-periods
in a different way. And the right
foundations for education and instruction
depend on the knowledge
of this law of the evolution of
human nature.</p>

<p>Before physical birth the nascent
human being is enclosed on all
sides by an alien physical body.
It does not come into contact independently
with the outward
physical world. The physical
body of the mother forms its environment.
This body alone can
influence the maturing fœtus.
Physical birth consists precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
in the fact that the physical body
of the mother releases the child,
thereby causing the surroundings
of the physical world to influence
him immediately. The senses open
themselves to the outward world,
and this latter is thereby able to
exercise those influences over the
child which were previously exercised
by the physical body of the
mother.</p>

<p>For a spiritual comprehension
of the world such as is represented
by Theosophy, the physical
body is then actually born, but not
yet the etheric or vital body. As
the child until the moment of its
birth is surrounded by the physical
body of the mother, so too until
the time of his second teeth, about
the age of seven, is he surrounded
by an etheric and an astral covering.
Not until the time of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
change of teeth does the etheric
covering release the etheric body.
Then until the time of puberty
there still remains an astral covering.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
At this period the astral
or desire body also becomes free
on all sides, as did the physical
body at the time of the physical
birth and the etheric body at the
time of the second teeth.</p>

<p>Thus then, Theosophy must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
speak of three births of man. Certain
impressions, which are intended
to reach the etheric body
can reach it as little, up to the
time of the second teeth, as the
light and air of the physical world
can reach the physical body while
it remains in the womb of the
mother.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the second
teeth the free vital body is not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
work. As the physical body, whilst
in the womb of the mother, receives
powers which are not its
own, and within that protective
covering gradually develops its
own, so is this also the case with
these later powers of growth, until
the time of the second teeth. Only
at this period does the etheric
body perfect its own powers in
conjunction with the inherited and
alien ones. During this time, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the etheric body is freeing itself,
the physical body is already independent.
The etheric body which
is gradually freeing itself, perfects
that which it has to give to the
physical body. And the final point
of this work is the child’s own
teeth, which come in the place of
those he has inherited. They are
the densest things embedded in the
physical body and therefore at
this period appear last.</p>

<p>After this period, the child’s
own etheric body takes care of
its growth alone. Only the latter
still remains under the influence
of an enveloped astral body. As
soon as the astral body becomes
free as well, a period is terminated
for the etheric body. This
termination takes place at the time
of puberty. The reproductive
organs become independent, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
from henceforth the free
astral body does not work inwardly,
but openly encounters the
external world.</p>

<p>As one is not able to let the
influences of the outward world
affect the child physically before
it is born, so those powers (which
are the same to him as the impressions
of the physical surroundings
to the physical body)
should not be allowed to affect
the etheric body before the time
of the second teeth. And
the corresponding influences upon
the astral body ought only to be
brought into play at the time of
puberty.</p>

<p>Common phrases, such as, “the
harmonious training of all the
powers and talents,” and the
like cannot form the foundation
for a true system of education,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
for this can only be built upon a
genuine knowledge of the human
being. We do not mean to affirm
that the above-mentioned phrases
are incorrect, but only that they
are as valueless as if one were to
say with regard to a machine, that
all its parts must be brought into
harmonious working order. Only
he who approaches it, not with
mere phrases, but with a real
knowledge of the particular kind
of machine, can handle it. This
applies also to the art of education,
to the knowledge of the principles
in a human being and of
their individual developments; one
must know which part of the human
being should be influenced at
a certain time of life, and how to
bring such influences to bear upon
him in a suitable manner. There
is indeed no doubt that a really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
intelligent system of education,
such as is outlined in these pages,
can make its way but slowly. This
is due to the manner of viewing
things in our day, wherein the
facts of the spiritual world will
still be considered for a long time
as merely the overflow of a mad
fantasy, while common-place and
entirely superficial phrases will
be regarded as the result of a
really practical way of thinking.
We shall here proceed to give a
free outline of what will be considered
by many at the present
time a mere mirage of the fancy,
but which will in time come to be
an accepted fact.</p>

<p>At physical birth, the physical
human body is exposed to the
physical environment of the external
world, whilst previously it
was encircled by the protective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
body of the mother. That which
the forces and fluids of the
mother’s body did to it previously
must now be done by the
forces and elements of the outer
physical world. Up to the time of
the second teething, at the age of
seven, the human body has a mission
to perform for itself, which
is essentially different from the
missions of all the other life-epochs.
The physical organs must
form themselves into certain
shapes during this time; then
structural proportions must take
definite directions and tendencies.
Later on growth takes place, but
this growth in all future time proceeds
on the bases of the shapes
which were in process of formation
until the time mentioned. If
normal shapes have been forming
themselves, normal shapes will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
afterwards grow, and conversely
from abnormal bases will proceed
abnormal results. One cannot
make amends in all the succeeding
years for that which, as guardian,
one has neglected during the first
seven years. As the right environment
for the physical human body
is provided by Nature, before
birth, so after birth it is the
duty of the guardian to provide
it. Only this correct physical
environment influences the
child in such a way that his
physical organs mould themselves
into the normal forms.</p>

<p>There are two magic words
which epitomise the relation
which is formed between the child
and its environment. These are:
Imitation and Example. Aristotle,
the Greek philosopher,
called man the most imitative of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
animals, and for no other period
of life is this more applicable than
for the age of childhood up to
the time of the second teething.
The child imitates whatever takes
place in its physical environment,
and in the imitation his physical
organs mould themselves into the
forms which then remain to them.
The term physical environment is
to be taken in the widest sense
imaginable. To it belongs not only
that which takes place materially
round the child, but everything
that is enacted in his surroundings,
everything that may be observed
by his senses, everything
that from all points of physical
space can influence his spiritual
forces. To it also belong all
actions, moral or immoral, sensible
or foolish, that the child may
see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>It is not by moral texts, nor
by rational precepts, but by
what is done visibly before the
child by the grown-up people
around him, that he is influenced
in the manner indicated. Instruction
produces effects only upon
the etheric body, not upon the
physical, and up to the age of
seven the etheric body is surrounded
by a protective etheric
shell, just as the physical body
until physical birth is surrounded
by the body of the mother. That
which ought to be developed in
this etheric body in the way of
ideas, habits, memory, etc., before
the age of seven, must develop itself
“spontaneously,” in the same
way as the eyes and ears develop
themselves in the womb of the
mother without the influence of
the external light. It is written in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
an excellent educational book, Jean
Paul’s <cite>Levana</cite> or <cite>Pedagogics</cite>, that
a world-traveller learns more from
his nurse in his early years than
in all of his travels put together.
This is undoubtedly true, but the
child does not learn by instruction,
but by imitation. And his
physical organs form themselves
through the influence of his physical
surroundings. A healthy
vision is formed when the right
colors and conditions of light are
brought into the child’s environment,
and the physical foundations
for a healthy moral nature
are formed in the brain and in the
circulation of the blood, when the
child sees moral things in his environment.
When the child, up to
the age of seven, sees only foolish
actions taking place around him,
his brain assumes such forms as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
to make him also, in later life,
capable only of foolishness.</p>

<p>As the muscles of the hand grow
strong and powerful when they do
work suitable for them, so the
brain and the other organs of the
physical human body will be directed
towards the right path, if
they receive the right impressions
from their environment. An example
will best illustrate the point
in question. A doll can be made
out of an old piece of cloth, by
making two corners serve for arms,
two for legs and a knot for the
head, with the eyes, nose and
mouth painted in ink—or a so-called
“beautiful” doll can be
bought with real hair and painted
cheeks, and given to the child.
The latter, it is hardly necessary
to say, is really horrible, and is
calculated to ruin the child’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
sound aesthetic taste for life.
Here the question of education is
quite a different one. If the child
has the rag-doll to look at, it has
to complete out of its own imagination
the impression of a human
being which the doll is intended to
convey. This work of the imagination
helps to build up the
forms of the brain, so that it
opens up as the muscles of the
hand expand by doing their natural
work. When the child possesses
the so-called “beautiful doll,”
there is nothing further for the
brain to do. It becomes, as it
were, stunted and dried up, instead
of expanding itself. If
people could look into the brain
after the manner of the occultist
and see it building itself up into
forms, they would certainly only
give their children that kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
plaything which is really able to
stimulate the creative powers of
the brain. All toys that are only
composed of dead mathematical
forms have a desolating and deadening
effect on the child’s formative
powers, whilst on the other
hand everything that stimulates
the perception of something living
tends to influence in the right direction.
Our materialistic age
produces but few good toys—such
for instance as that in which two
movable pieces of wood are made
to represent two smiths facing one
another and hammering at some
object. Such things may still be
bought in the country. Very good
also are those picture books in
which the figures are made to be
pulled by strings, thus enabling
the child to transform the dead
picture into a representation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
action. All this produces an inner
activity of the organs, and out of
this activity the right form of the
organs builds itself up.</p>

<p>Of course these things can only
just be indicated here, but in the
future occult science will be called
upon to point out that which in
each particular case is necessary,
and this it is able to do. For it
is not an empty abstraction, but a
body of vital facts quite able to
furnish the guiding-lines for practical
matters.</p>

<p>One or two further examples
will serve as illustrations. According
to occult science a so-called
nervous excitable child
should be treated differently from
a lethargic and inactive one, with
regard to its surroundings. Everything
must be taken into consideration,
from the color of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
room and the various objects by
which the child is generally surrounded,
to the color of the
clothes in which it is dressed.
One may often do the wrong
thing, unless willing to be guided
by occult science, for a materialistic
tendency will in many cases
hit on just the opposite of what is
right. An excitable child should
be clothed and surrounded with
red or reddish-yellow colors, whilst
for the opposite type of child,
blue or bluish-green should be
selected. For, in accordance with
the color used outwardly is the
complementary color produced inwardly.
Thus, for instance, green
is produced by red; orange-yellow
by blue, and of this one may easily
be convinced by looking for a time
on a spot of a particular color
and then quickly directing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
eyes to a white surface. This
complementary color is produced
by the physical organs of the child,
and in turn reacts upon the corresponding
organic structures
necessary to the child. Red in
the environment of an excitable
child produces inwardly the green
complementary picture. The activity
thus produced by the sensation
of green has a calming effect
and the organs take upon themselves
the tendency to composure.</p>

<p>One rule must invariably be
taken into consideration at this
period of life—that the physical
body has to create for itself the
standard of what is suitable to
it. It does this through the corresponding
development of desire.
Generally speaking it may be said
that the healthy physical body desires
only what is good for it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
And as long as it is a question
only of the physical body of the
growing child, one ought to notice
carefully what it is that is sought
by the healthy desires, cravings
and pleasures. Joy and pleasure
are the powers which draw out
the physical forms of the organs,
in the best way.</p>

<p>A very great error may be committed
in this direction by not
placing the child in the suitable
physical conditions with regard
to its environment. This can especially
be the case with regard
to the instinct of nourishment.
The child can be overfed with
things that make him completely
lose healthy instincts of nourishment,
whilst through correct feeding
they can be preserved for him
so fully, that he will ask (even to
a glass of water) for that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
under given circumstances is good
for him, and will refuse anything
that may be harmful. When
occult science is called upon to
construct a system of education,
it will be able to specify, even to
the particular articles of nourishment
and table luxuries, all that
has here to be considered. For
it is a practical teaching, applicable
to life, and no mere colorless
theory—as indeed one might suppose,
from the mistakes of many
Theosophists of today.</p>

<p>Among the forces therefore
which affect the physical organs
by moulding them, must be included
an element of joy with
and amid the surroundings. Let
the guardian be cheerful of countenance,
and above all things let
there be true and not artificial
love—a love that flowing warmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
through the physical environment,
as it were, incubates, in the true
sense of the word, the forms of
the physical organs.</p>

<p>When within such an atmosphere
of love, the imitation of
healthy models is possible, the
child is in his right element.
Special attention should therefore
be given that nothing may happen
in the child’s environment that
he should not imitate. Nothing
should be done that would necessitate
saying to the child “You
must not do that.” Of the way
in which the child tries to imitate,
one may be convinced by observing
how it can copy written
letters long before it can understand
them. It is indeed an advisable
thing for the child to copy
the written characters first, and then
later to learn their meaning. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
imitation belongs to the developing
stage of the physical body,
whilst the mind responds to the
etheric body, and this latter ought
only to be influenced after the
time of the second teeth, when its
outer etheric covering is gone.
Especially should the learning of
speech by means of imitation take
place in these years. For <em>by
hearing</em> the child best learns to
speak. All rules and artificial
teaching can do no good at all.</p>

<p>In the early years of childhood
it is especially important that
such means of education as, for
instance, songs for children should
make as beautiful a rhythmic impression
on the senses as possible.
The importance lies in the
beautiful sound rather than in the
sense. The more invigorating the
effect which anything can have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
upon the eye and ear, the better
it is. The power of building up
the organs which lies in dancing
movements when put to a musical
rhythm, for example, must not be
under-estimated.</p>

<p>With the change of teeth the
etheric body throws off its outer
covering, and then the time begins
in which the training of the etheric
body may be carried on from
without. One must be clear as to
what it is that can influence the
etheric body in this way. The
transformation and growth of the
etheric body signify, respectively,
the transformation and development
of the affections, the habits,
conscience, character, memory
and temperament. One is able
to influence the etheric body by
pictures, by example, by regulated
guidance of the imagination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Just as the child, until it has
reached the age of seven, ought to
be given a physical model which it
can imitate, so too, in the environment
of the developing child, between
the period of the second
teeth and that of puberty, everything
should be brought into play
that possesses an inner sense and
value upon which the child may
direct his attention. All that conduces
to thought, all that works
through image and parable, has
now its rightful place.</p>

<p>The etheric body develops its
power when a well regulated imagination
is directed upon that
which it can unravel or extract
for its guidance from living images
and parables, or from such as are
addressed to the spirit. It is <em>concrete</em>
and not <em>abstract</em> ideas that
can rightly influence the growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
body—ideas that are spiritually
rather than materially concrete.
A spiritual standpoint is the right
means of education during these
years. It is therefore of paramount
importance that the youth
at this period has around him in
his guardians themselves personalities
through whose points of
view the desirable intellectual and
moral powers may be awakened
in him.</p>

<p>As “imitation” and “example”
are the magic words for the training
of children in their early
years, so for the years now in
question the corresponding words
are “hero-worship” and “authority.”
Natural and not forced authority
must supply the immediate
spiritual standpoint, with the
help of which the youth forms for
himself conscience, habits and inclinations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
brings his temperament
into regulated paths, and
wins his own outlook on this
world. The beautiful words of
the poet: “Everyone must choose
his own hero, in whose steps he
may find the way to Olympus,”
are of special value with regard
to this epoch of life.</p>

<p>Veneration and reverence are
powers that assist the etheric body
to grow in the right way. And
he to whom it is impossible, during
this period, to look up to anyone
with unlimited reverence, will
have to suffer on that account for
the rest of his life. When this
veneration is missing, the vital
forces of the etheric body are
checked. Picture to yourself the
following in its effect on the
youthful disposition: a boy of
eight years of age is told of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
person highly esteemed. All that
he hears about him fills him with
holy awe. The day draws near
on which he is to see this honored
person for the first time. A profound
reverence overcomes him
when he hears the bell-ring at the
door, behind which the object of
his veneration is to become visible.
The beautiful feelings which
are produced by such an experience,
belong to the lasting acquisitions
of life. And <em>that</em> man
is fortunate, who not only during
the happy moments of life, but
continuously, is able to look up to
his teachers and instructors as to
his natural authorities.</p>

<p>To these living authorities, to
these embodiments of moral and
intellectual power, must be added
the authorities perceived of the
spirit. The grand examples of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
history, the tales of model men
and women, must fix the conscience
and the intellectual tendency—and
not abstract moral
truths, which can only do their
right work, when, at the age of
puberty, the astral body is freed
from its astral covering.</p>

<p>One ought especially to guide
the teaching of history into
courses determined by such points
of view. Before the time of the
second teeth, the stories, fairy
tales, etc., which are told to the
child, can only have for their aim,
joy, recreation, and pleasure.</p>

<p>After this time it will be necessary
to use forethought concerning
the matter that is to be related,
so that pictures of life, such
as he can beneficially emulate,
may be set before the soul of the
young person. It must not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
overlooked that bad habits can be
ousted by pictures correspondingly
repulsive. Warnings against
such bad habits and tendencies
are at best of little avail, but if
one were to let the living picture
of a bad man affect the youthful
imagination, explaining the result
to which the tendency in question
leads, one would do much toward
its extermination.</p>

<p>One thing to bear always in
mind is, that it is not abstract
representations that influence the
developing etheric body, but living
pictures in their spiritual
clearness, and, of course, these
latter must be applied with the
utmost tact, for otherwise the opposite
to what is desired will be
the result. In the matter of
stories it is always a question of
the way in which they are told.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
The verbal narration of a tale can
therefore not be successfully replaced
by a reading of it.</p>

<p>During the time between the
second teeth and puberty, the
spiritually pictorial, or, as one
might also call it, the symbolical
representation, ought to be considered
in yet another way. It is
necessary that the young person
should learn to know the secrets
of nature, the laws of life, as far
as possible through symbols and
not by the means of dry and intellectual
ideas. Allegories about
the spiritual relation of things
ought so to reach the soul that
the law and order of existence
underlying the allegories is rather
perceived and divined, than grasped
by the means of intellectual ideas.
The saying that “all things transient
are only symbols” ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
to form an all-important motto
for the education during this
period. It is very important for
a person to receive the secrets
of nature in allegories before
they appear to his soul in the
form of natural laws, etc. An
example will make this clear.
Supposing one wished to speak to
a young person of the immortality
of the soul, of its going forth
from the body, one might as an
instance make the comparison of
the butterfly emerging from the
chrysalis. As the butterfly comes
forth from the chrysalis, so the
soul comes forth from the shell
of the body after death. No one
who has not previously received
them by means of some such
image, will adequately grasp the
right facts in the abstract ideas.
For by such a simile one speaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
not only to the intellect, but also
to the sensations and feelings, to
the whole soul. The youth having
gone through all this, approaches
the matter in quite a different attitude
of mind when it is given to
him later in intellectual conceptions.
Indeed the man who cannot
first approach the riddle of
existence with this feeling is much
to be pitied. It is necessary that
the teacher should have similes at
his disposal for all natural laws
and secrets of the world.</p>

<p>In this matter it is quite clear
what an enriching effect occult
science must have upon practical
life. Any one constructing from
a materialistic and intellectual
mode of representation, similes
for himself and then propounding
them to young people, will usually
make but little impression upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
them. For such a person ought first
to puzzle out the similes himself
with all his mental capacities.
Those similes which one has not
first applied for oneself, do not
have a convincing effect on those
to whom they are imparted. When
one talks to somebody in parables,
then he is not only influenced by
what one says or shows, but there
passes a fine spiritual stream
from the speaker to the hearer.
Unless the speaker himself has an
ardent feeling of belief in his
similes, he will make no impression
on the one to whom he gives
them. In order to create a right
influence, one must believe in one’s
similes oneself as if in realities;
and that can only be done when
one possesses the mystical tendency,
and when the similes themselves
are born of occult science.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
The real occultist does not need
to worry about the above-mentioned
simile of the soul going
forth from the body, because for
him it is a truth. To him the
butterfly evolving from the chrysalis
represents the same experience
on a lower stage of nature’s
existence as the going forth of
the soul from the body at a higher
stage development. He believes
in it with all his might, and this
belief flows forth as if in invisible
streams from the speaker to the
listener, and inspires conviction.
Direct life-streams then flow forth
from teacher to pupil. But for
this end it is necessary for the
teacher to draw from the full
source of occult science; it is
necessary that his word and all
that goes forth from him, should
be clothed with feeling, warmth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and glowing emotion from the true
occult view of life. For this reveals
a magnificent perspective
of the whole subject of education.
Once the latter allows itself
to be enriched from the life
source of occult science, it will
itself become permeated with a
profound vitality. It will give
up groping in the dark, so common
in this particular domain of
thought. All educational methods,
all educational sciences, that do
not continually receive a supply
of fresh sap from such roots, are
dried up and dead. For all world-secrets
occult science has fitting
similes, similes not rising from
the mind of man but drawn from
the essence of things, having
been laid down as a basis by the
forces of the world at their creation.
Occult science must therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
be the basis for any system
of education.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A power of the soul to which
particular attention ought to be
given at this period of development
is that of memory. For the
cultivation of the memory is connected
with the transformation
of the etheric body. This has its
effect in the fact that precisely
during the time between the coming
of the second teeth and that
of puberty it becomes free, so that
this is also the period in which
the further development of the
memory should be looked after
from outside. The memory will
be permanently of less value to
the person in question than it
might have been, if at this period
what is necessary to it is neglected.
That which has thus been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
neglected cannot afterwards be
retrieved.</p>

<p>An intellectual and materialistic
way of thinking is liable to
bring about many mistakes in this
direction. A system of education
arising from this way of thinking
is easily prejudiced against that
which is acquired merely by the
memory. It will not tire at times
of directing itself with the greatest
ardor against the mere training
of the memory, and rather
makes use of the most ingenious
methods that the young person
may not mechanically absorb what
he does not really understand.
An opinion merely intellectual
and materialistic is so easily persuaded
that there is no means of
penetrating into things except by
abstract ideas; it is only with
difficulty that thinkers of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
kind come to the conclusion that
the other subjective powers are
at least just as necessary to the
comprehension of things, as the
intellect itself. It is not merely a
figure of speech to say that one
can understand just as well with
the feelings, the emotions, the
mind, as with the intellect. Ideas
are only one of the means by
which to understand the things
of this world, and only to materialists
do they appear the only
means. There are, of course,
many people who do not imagine
that they are materialists, but
who nevertheless consider an intellectual
conception to be the only
means of comprehension. Such
men profess perhaps to hold an
idealistic, perhaps even a spiritual
conception of the world and
life. But the attitude of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
souls toward both is materialistic.
For the intellect is, as a matter
of fact, the soul’s instrument for
the comprehension of material
things.</p>

<p>And here, concerning the deeper
foundations of the understanding,
let us quote from that excellent
educational book, by Jean
Paul already mentioned—a work
containing generally golden ideas
concerning education and deserving
of much more consideration
than at present it receives. It is
of much more value to the guardian
than many of the writings
on these lines that enjoy the highest
repute. The passage under
consideration runs thus:</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid of unintelligibility,
even if it be of whole
sentences; your look and the manner
of your expression, added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the eager desire to understand,
elucidates the one half, and with
this, and in due time, the other half
also. For with children, as with the
Chinese and with men of the world,
the manner of pronunciation is half
the language. Bear in mind, that
they understand their language as
well as we understand Greek or any
other foreign tongue before learning
to speak it. Trust to the deciphering
of time and to association.
A child of five years of age
understands indeed the words
“yet,” “truly,” “on the contrary,”
“of course”; but for a definition of
them one must go not to the child,
but to the father! The little word
“but” reveals a small philosopher.
If the eight-year-old child with his
growing power of speech is understood
by a child of three, why should
you then confine your language to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
his babbling? Always speak several
years in advance (for in books
genius speaks to us centuries in
advance); with the child of a year,
speak as if it were two, with the
child of two as if it were six, for
the difference of growth may diminish
in inverse proportion to the
years. Generally speaking, all
learning is apt to be too much ascribed
to the credit of the teacher—therefore
the teacher ought to bear
in mind that the child possesses
half his world, namely, the spiritual
(such as his moral and metaphysical
ideas), already complete and taught
within himself, and that therefore a
language composed only of concrete
images can never impart
spiritual ideas, but can only light
them up. The joy and assurance
used in speaking to children ought
to be given as if the assurance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
joy came from themselves. We can
learn speech from them, just as we
teach them by means of speech; by
means of bold and yet correct word-painting,
such as for instance I
have heard spoken by children of
three and four years of age: ‘leg-fish’
for otter; ‘pig-iron’ for the
fork used in eating bacon; ‘the air-mouse’
(unquestionably superior
to our word ‘bat’) and so on.”</p>

<p>It is true that this passage refers
to the understanding (before
the intellectual comprehension) as
exercised in another sphere than
that of which we are now speaking,
but for this also, the words
of Jean Paul have an important
meaning. Just as the child receives
into his soul’s organism the
construction of speech, without
making use of the laws of grammatical
structure with intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
comprehension, so too, for the cultivation
of his memory, the youth
ought to learn things of which he
will not until later acquire an
actual understanding. That which
has been acquired in this period
of life, at first in a purely mechanical
way, is best put into
ideas, afterwards, just as one
learns more easily the rules of a
language when one can already
speak it. All the talk of work
learned by rote and not understood
is nothing more than a materialistic
prejudice. For instance, the
youth needs only to acquire by a
few examples the most necessary
rules of multiplication, for which
the fingers are far better suited
than an abacus, and then to
learn fully, by rote, the multiplication
table. If one so proceeds,
one takes into account the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of the growing child. But a mistake
may be made with regard to
this, if, during the time that the
memory is forming itself, too
much is demanded of the intellect.
The intellect being a power of the
soul, and only born at the time of
puberty, ought not to receive an
outward influence before this
period. Until the time of puberty,
the youth should assimilate into
the memory treasures over which
mankind has meditated; later on
it is time to permeate with ideas
that which has been impressed
upon his memory. A man ought
therefore not to retain merely
what he has understood, but he
ought now to understand the
things that he knows; that is to
say, the things of which he has
already taken possession by means
of the memory, just as the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
does, when learning to speak.
This applies to a wider sphere.
At first, assimilation of historical
events by mere rote, then comprehension
of the same by means of
ideas. At first, a good impression
upon the memory of geographical
data, then an understanding of
the relationship of each thing with
the rest, etc. In certain respects
all comprehension through ideas
should be done by means of the
stored treasures of the memory.
The more the youth already knows
through the memory before he
comes to comprehension, the better
it is. It is hardly necessary
to explain that all this applies only
to the period, of which we are
speaking, and not to any later
period. If one learns a subject in
later life, either by going over
it again, or in any other way, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
opposite process to that here described
might be correct and desirable,
although even then a great
deal depends upon the particular
spiritual nature of the student.
But at the time of life of which
we have already spoken the spirit
must not be parched by being
overcrowded with intellectual
ideas.</p>

<p>It is also true that teaching by
mere sense-objects, if carried too
far, is the result of a materialistic
view of life. At this age every
idea must be spiritualised. One
ought not, for instance, to be satisfied
with merely producing a
sense-impression of a plant, a
grain of seed, or a blossom.
Everything should seem as an allegory
of the spiritual. A grain of
seed is, in truth, not merely what
it appears to the eye. Invisibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the whole new plant inhabits it,
and that such a thing is more than
what the sense perceives, must
be absolutely realised with the perception,
the imagination, and the
feelings. The mysterious presence
of latent existence must really be
felt. Nor can it be objected that
such a proceeding would weaken
the perception of pure sense; on
the contrary, by a persistent adherence
to sense perceptions alone,
Truth itself would be the loser.
For the complete reality of a thing
exists in Spirit and in Matter,
and accurate observations can be
no less carefully carried out if one
brings to the study not only the
physical senses, but also the spiritual
faculties. If people could only
perceive, as the Occultist is able
to, how both body and soul are
spoiled by mere object-teaching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
they would not then lay so much
stress upon it. Of what value is
it from the highest point of view,
if young people are shown all
kinds of physical experiments in
the mineral, vegetable and animal
worlds, if with such a study
one does not suggest the application
of the sense allegory to the
feeling of spiritual mystery? Certainly
a materialistic mind will
not be able to make anything of
what has here been said, and of
that the Occultist is only too conscious.
Yet it is also clear to
him that a really practical method
of education can never proceed
from the materialistic mind. So
practical does such a mind imagine
itself, and yet so unpractical
is it in reality, when it is a
matter of considering life vitally.
Opposed to the true reality, materialistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
opinions seem only fantastic,
while to the materialist, the
interpretations of occult science
must, of necessity, appear equally
fantastic. Doubtless, too, there
will remain many obstacles which
must be overcome before the fundamental
teachings of occult science,
arising from life itself, will
permeate the art of education.
But that is to be expected, for at
present these truths are strange
to many; nevertheless, if they be
really the truth, they will incorporate
themselves into all culture.</p>

<p>Only through the sure conviction
that they are the only educational
means by which to work
upon young people, can the teacher
always find the right way to deal
correctly with each individual
case. Thus, he must know how
the individual powers of the soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
—such as thinking, feeling and
willing—ought to be treated, and
how their development may react
upon the etheric body; while this
itself, between the period when the
second teeth appear and that of
puberty, can be perfectly moulded
by outside influences.</p>

<p>The foundations for the development
of a healthy and powerful
will can be laid by the right management,
during the first seven
years, of those fundamental principles
of education which have
already been considered. For
such a will must have for its support
the fully developed form of
the physical body. From the
period of the second teething it
begins to be a matter of making
the etheric body, which is now developing,
supply those powers to
the physical body by which it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
solidify its form and make itself
firm. That which makes the most
vivid impression upon the etheric
body also reacts most forcibly
upon the strengthening of the
physical. And the strongest impulses
are evoked in the etheric
body through those perceptions
and ideas by which a person feels
and experiences his own relation
to the everlasting Universe, that
is to say, through religious experiences.
The will, and along with it,
the character, of a person will
never develop healthily if he cannot
experience at this epoch of
life, profound religious impulses.
The result of the uniform organisation
of the will is that the person
feels himself to be an organic
fragment of the whole world. If
the person does not feel himself to
be indissolubly connected with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Supreme Spirit, then must the will
and character remain unstable,
discordant and unhealthy.</p>

<p>The emotional nature is developed
in the right direction by
means of the allegories and sense-pictures
already described, and especially
by all which, whether from
history or from other sources,
presents to us the figures of persons
with character. An absorption
in the mysteries and beauties
of Nature is also of importance in
the upbuilding of the emotional
world. And here it is particularly
well to consider the culture of the
sense of beauty, and the awakening
of the feeling for what is artistic.
Music should supply that
rhythm to the etheric body which
then enables it to perceive in
everything the rhythm otherwise
concealed. A young person will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
deprived of much in all his after
life, who does not receive at this
period the benefit of cultivating
the musical sense. To him in
whom this sense is altogether lacking,
a certain aspect of the Universe
must remain hidden. Nor
should, however, the other arts be,
by any means neglected. The
awakening of the sense for architectural
form, as also for plastic
shape, for line, design and harmony
of color—not one of these
ought to be omitted in the plan
of education. So simply, perhaps,
might all this be done, under
special circumstances, that the objection
that circumstances allow
of no development at all in this
direction can never be valid. One
can do much with the simplest
means, if the right sense in this
direction prevails in the teacher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
himself. The joy of life, the love
for existence, the strength to
work—all these arise for the whole
being, out of the cultivation of
the sense of beauty and art. And
the relations of man to man—how
ennobled and how beautiful will
they become through this sense! The
moral sense, which will, at this
period, be developed by pictures
of life and by standard authorities,
will also gain a certain stability
if, through the sense of
beauty, the good is recognized as
beautiful and the bad as ugly.</p>

<p>Thought in its own shape, as
an inner life of distilled ideas,
must, at the period in question,
be kept in the background. It
must develop spontaneously, as it
were, uninfluenced from without,
while the soul is nourished by
means of similes and pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
representing life and the mysteries
of nature. Thus, in the
midst of the other experiences of
the soul between the seventh
year and the time of puberty,
thought must grow and the
faculty for judgment be matured,
so that after a successful puberty
the person becomes capable of
forming his own opinions concerning
the matters of life and
knowledge, with complete independence.
Indeed, the less one
works directly upon the critical
faculty, and the more one works
indirectly through the development
of the other spiritual
powers, the better will it be for
the whole after-life of the person
concerned.</p>

<p>Occult science lays down the
principles, not only for the spiritual
side of education, but also for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the purely physical. Thus, to
give a characteristic example, let
us consider gymnastics and children’s
games. Just as love and
joy must permeate the environment
during the first years of
childhood, so too the growing
etheric body must be taught really
to experience from bodily exercise
a feeling of its own expansion,
of its ever increasing
strength. For instance gymnastic
exercises ought to be so carried
out that with every movement,
with every step, the feeling
rises in the inner self of the boy
or girl: “I feel increasing power
within me.” And this feeling
should manifest itself within as
a healthy delight, as a sensation
of pleasure. For the devising of
gymnastic exercises, in this sense,
it is of course necessary to possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
more than a merely intellectual
knowledge of the human body,
anatomically and physiologically.
It is necessary to possess a close
intuitive and sympathetic knowledge
of the relation of joy and
comfort to the postures and movements
of the human body. The
formulator of such exercises
ought himself to experience how
one movement or posture of the
limbs will produce a pleasant and
comfortable sensation, but another
a loss of strength, and so forth.
A belief that gymnastics and
bodily exercises can be cultivated
in this direction is one that can
only be supplied to the educator
by occult science, or, above all, by
a mind sympathetic to such
thought. One does not even require
the power of vision in the
spiritual worlds, but only the inclination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
to apply to life what
has been given out by occultism.
If, especially in such practical departments
as this of education,
occult knowledge were applied, then
all the useless talk of how this
knowledge has yet to be proved
would straightway cease. For to
him who should rightly apply it,
this knowledge would itself be a
proof through the whole of life
by making him healthy and strong.
By such means he would perceive,
through and through, that
it is true in actual practice, and
this he would find a better proof
than any manner of “logical” and
so-called “scientific” reasons. One
can best know spiritual truths by
their fruits, and not through a
pretended proof, however scientific,
for such could hardly be
anything more than a logical skirmishing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>At puberty the astral body is
first born. With the free outward
development which follows, all
that which is unfolded by the
world of externalised perceptions,
by one’s judgment and the unfettered
understanding, will first
rush inward upon the soul. It has
already been mentioned that these
faculties of the soul, hitherto uninfluenced
from within, ought to
be developed by the right management
of educational means,
just as unconsciously as the eyes
and ears evolve themselves in the
womb. But with puberty the
time has arrived when the person
is ready to form his own judgment
concerning the things which
he has hitherto learned. No
greater injury can be inflicted on
any one than by too soon awakening
within him his own judgment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
One should only judge when one
has already stored up the necessary
qualifications for judging
and comparing. If, before this,
one creates one’s own independent
opinions, then these will have
no sure foundations. All one-sidedness
in life, all dreary “confessions
of faith” which are based
upon a few mere scraps of knowledge,
and the desire to judge from
these human conceptions that have
been approved through long ages
of time, rest upon just such mistakes
in education. Before qualified
to think, one must place before
oneself, as a warning, what
others have thought. There is no
sound thinking which has not been
preceded by a sound perception
of the truth supported by obvious
authority. If one wishes to follow
out these principles of education,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
one must not allow people,
at too early an age, to fancy themselves
able to judge, for in avoiding
this, one will leave them the
possibility of allowing life to work
upon them from every side, and
without prejudice. For by one
such judgment, which is not
founded on the precious basis of
spiritual treasures, he who makes
it will have placed a stumbling-block
in the path of his life. For
if one has pronounced a judgment
on any subject, one will always
be influenced by having done so;
one will no longer regard an experience
as one might have regarded
it, if one had not erected
an opinion which is henceforth intertwined
with the subject in question.
In young people the disposition
to learn first and then to
judge, should be present. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
which the intellect has to say of
a certain subject ought only to be
said when all the other powers of
soul have spoken; before that the
intellect ought only to play the
part of mediator. It should only
serve to lay hold of what is seen
and felt, to apprehend it as it
there exists, without allowing the
unripe judgment to take possession
of the matter. Therefore
the youth ought to be shielded
from all the theories concerning
a thing, before the above-mentioned
age, and it should be especially
emphasized that he should
face the experiences of life in
order to admit them into his soul.
A growing individual can certainly
be made acquainted with what
people have thought concerning
this or that, but one should avoid
letting him form opinions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
arise from a premature judgment.
He should receive opinions with
the feelings, without deciding at
once for one view or the other,
not attaching himself to a party,
but thinking, as he listens: “One
has said this, and the other that.”
Before all things a large measure
of tact is necessary in the cultivation
of this sense by teachers
and guardians, but occult knowledge
is exactly calculated to supply
such tact.</p>

<p>It has only been possible to develop
here a few aspects of education
in the light of Occultism,
but it has only been intended to
give a hint as to what problems
of civilisation this philosophy will
have to solve. Whether it can do
so depends on whether the inclination
for such a way of thinking
henceforth broadens out in ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
widening circles. In order that
this may take place, two things
are necessary: first, that people
should abandon their prejudice
against Occultism. He who will
truly associate himself with it,
will soon see that it is not the
fantastical trash which so many today
imagine it to be. This is not
intended as a reproach to such
people, for everything which our
time offers as a means of education
must, at first, engender the
view that occultists are fantastics
and dreamers. On the surface
any other view is hardly possible,
for there appears to be the most
complete diversity between what
is known as Occult Science or
Theosophy, and all that the culture
of the present day suggests
as the principles for a healthy
view of life. Only a deeper consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
reveals to us how entirely
in opposition the views of
the present must remain without
these principles of occult science—how,
indeed, they themselves call
out these very principles and in
the long run cannot remain without
them. The second thing that
is necessary is connected with the
sound development of Theosophy
itself. Life will only welcome
Theosophy, if in theosophical circles
the knowledge is made to permeate
everywhere that it is important
to make these teachings
bear fruit in the widest manner
for all conditions of life, and not
merely to theorize about them.
Otherwise people will continue to
look upon Theosophy as a kind of
religious sectarianism, only fit
for some fanatical enthusiasts.
But if it performs positive useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
spiritual work, then the theosophical
movement cannot, in the
long run, be refused an intelligent
hearing.</p>

This distinction is important, for the
ideas of the present time with regard to
this subject are rather inaccurate. The
difference between the vegetable and the
creature gifted with the power of sensation
is completely lost sight of, because the
essential characteristic of sensibility is
not clearly defined. When a being (or an
object) responds to an exterior impression
by showing any effect whatever, it is
inaccurate to conclude that this impression
has been felt. To bear out this
conclusion the impression must be experienced
inwardly, that is to say, the outside
stimulus must produce a kind of interior
reflection. The great progress of natural
science, which a true Theosophist must
sincerely admire, has thrown our abstract
vocabulary into confusion. Some of our
biologists are ignorant of the characteristics
of sensibility, and thus accredit it to
beings who are devoid of it. Sensibility
such as is comprehended by those biologists,
can, it is true, be attributed to organisms
deprived of it. But what is
understood by Theosophy as sensibility is
a totally different quality.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3_3" href="#FNanchor_3_3" class="label">3</a>
A distinction must be made between
the conscious inner life of the astral body
and the perception of this life by outward
clairvoyant observation. Here this latter
perception by a trained clairvoyant is intended.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4_4" href="#FNanchor_4_4" class="label">4</a>
The reader need not object to the
technical term “Body of the ego,” because
there is nothing of gross physical matter
meant by it, but occult science being forced
to employ the vocabulary of ordinary
language, the words applied to Theosophy
ought from the outset to be taken in a
spiritual sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5_5" href="#FNanchor_5_5" class="label">5</a>
The terms “Spirit-Self”, “Life-Spirit”
and “Spirit-Man” need not mystify the
reader; they stand for those transmutations
of our grosser bodies which are the
results of conscious effort and pure aspirations;
they form, in other words, the
Higher Trinity, called in Eastern terminology:
Manas, Buddhi and Atma, respectively.

Were these affirmations to be wrongly
interpreted, the objection might be raised
that a child before cutting his second teeth
is not deprived of memory, and that before
reaching the age of puberty, he possesses
the inherent faculties of the astral
body. It must not be forgotten that the
etheric and astral bodies are in existence
from the moment of physical birth, although
surrounded by the protecting shell
described. It is precisely this envelope,
protecting the etheric body, which permits
of a remarkably good memory before the
cutting of the second teeth. The existence
of physical eyes in the embryonic
being, concealed in the womb of the mother,
is analogous. And in the same way that
the physical eyes sheltered from all external
influence do not owe their development
to the physical sunlight, so also education
from without should not intervene
before the cutting of the second teeth in
the training of the memory. Very much
to the contrary, the spontaneous growth
of the memory will be noticeable, provided
there is food for it within reach, and no
attempt be made to train it by means of
exterior methods.
</p>
<p>
This observation applies equally to the
qualities belonging to the astral body
before puberty. Provision should be made
for their training, but bearing in mind that
this body is still encompassed by a protecting
shell. It is something wholly different
to take care of the germs which are
in process of development within the astral
body before puberty and to expose the freed
astral body <em>after</em> puberty to what it can
assimilate in the outer world, <em>without</em> the
protecting shell. This distinction is certainly
very subtle, but without its careful
consideration the whole significance of
education cannot be understood.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
